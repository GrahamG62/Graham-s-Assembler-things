# Graham-s-Assembler-things
This is a library that I wrote back in 2001, using the Herculers Emulator whilst between jobs. It contains a savearea stack manager, a descent recursive parser and a disassembler plus associated macros and examples. My goal was to make structured IBM assembler easy to write and use.
